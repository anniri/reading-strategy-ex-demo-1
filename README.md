# Prototype/demo for reading strategy exercise

This React application is a demo for the client side of a reading strategy exercise.

App takes a text and renders that to the browser. It also renders a question form: reader has to come up with a set number of multichoice and open questions about the text. The form renders either beside the text (wide screens) or as a drawer view (small screens). After submit, the app renders a test form based on the submitted questions.

## Application's objectives 

Coming up with some questions about the read text is a good way to highlight the important parts of the text. Making the reader answer these questions helps them to memorize the important parts. 

## Features to be added and other thoughts for updates:
- A timer: user has to wait some time (e.g. 30 seconds) before they are able to answer their questions.
- Rebuild app's state handling using Context API
